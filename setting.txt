# OCR SETTINGS
# ===========================
# These settings influence the OCR process.
# - ocr_exe_filepath: Set this to the path where Tesseract-OCR is installed.
# - thread_number: Number of threads to use for OCR (higher = faster processing).

# KEY PRESS SETTINGS
# ===========================
# Adjust these values to control the speed of key presses.
# - key_press_duration: Time (in seconds) to hold down the key.
# - key_press_delay: Time (in seconds) to wait after releasing the key.
# Increasing these values may slow down processing, but decreasing them too much
# may cause Nightreign to miss inputs and take multiple screenshots of the same relic.
